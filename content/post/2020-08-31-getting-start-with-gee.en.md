The Google Earth Engine platform has totally changed the way a remote sensing carrying out data processing and doing research. After playing with GEE for a while, I never want to go back to the traditional desktop based software for RS data processing, although it can be time consuming to get familiar with the data structure and language grammar employed by GEE. There are some other similar cloud based platforms under development in Europe and China, but currently GEE is much more mature and contains all the commonly used RS data. like Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS etc. Here I summarize some of my experience in self-learning GEE. 

1. The most important point I think is to remember always learning by doing and using, which apply to any new stuff we want to learn.

2. Get a VPN that allows you to get access to Google and register a GEE account at [here](https://earthengine.google.com/).

3. Get familiar with the background and structure of GEE through many of the talks given by Noel, the founder of GEE, for example, this one given at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en/sci/centra/rymdcenter/forelasningar-och-ev/lecture-google-earth-engine-1.687736).

4. Go through the [GEE guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/getstarted), try some examples, get some test data to see how GEE organized the RS data and how to get the data you look for.

5. Google search any problems you encountered, it is very like you'll find the answer right away, particularly in the beginning.

6. I usually use GEE to process the data, download the results in Google Drive, and polishing and making figures in Rstudio.

7. Always keep your objectives in mind, don't get lost in the plenty of fancy features GEE provides.

8. We'll update whatever we discovered to be important and common to mention...
